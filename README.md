## Bird Song Classification

Developed a Python-based machine learning project aimed at identifying bird species from their songs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project involved several key stages:
- Data Collection: Compiled a comprehensive dataset of bird songs from various online repositories and field recordings. Each audio file was labeled with the corresponding bird species.

-  Preprocessing: Converted the audio files into spectrograms, visual representations of the sound frequencies over time, to serve as input for the CNN. Applied techniques such as noise reduction and normalization to enhance the quality of the spectrograms.

-  Model Development: Designed and trained a CNN model tailored to the specific features of bird songs. Experimented with various architectures to optimize accuracy and performance.

- Training and Validation: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance. Utilized techniques such as data augmentation and dropout to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

- Evaluation: Assessed the model's accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tuned the model based on the evaluation results to enhance its predictive capabilities.

- Deployment: Implemented the trained model into a user-friendly application, allowing users to upload audio recordings of bird songs and receive instant species identification.

The project demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs in audio pattern recognition and contributed to the field of ornithology by providing a tool for automatic bird species identification from their songs.
